# CurrencyCalculator
The Currency Converter App is a handy tool designed to help users quickly and easily convert between different currencies.
In this project I focused on learning and using REST API. To connect to it, I used the Spiring RestTemplate class to connect to the API and the ObjectMapper class of the jackson package to parse the received data in json format into a specially prepared object. The user interface is clear and easy to use, allowing you to enter the amount and select the currency it is in, as well as select the target currency from among 10 popular items. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the free subscription on the website of the API used, only amounts in dollars can be entered. However, the website written in HTML and the application logic are prepared to accept amounts in other than dollar currencies.
